Tribute (Greatest Ship in the World) (129/400/400)

ðŸŽµThis is the greatest and best ship in the world: Tribute

Long time ago, me and my droids here
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny Jedi
In the middle of the road
And he said

"Build the best ship in the world, or I'll chop your limbs"
Well, those damn droids 
They looked at each other
And they all said
"Roger"

And they built the first thing that came to their heads
Just so happened to be
The best ship in the world
It was the best ship in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one makes two, two and one makes three
It was destiny
Once every hundred thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine, and the sabers doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Well, needless to say
The wizard was stunned
Snap-hiss went his laser blade
And the fight was on
He asked us, "are you endless?"
And we said yay
We are but droids, rock!

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ya
Wo-oh, wo-oh

This is not the greatest ship in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Had to surrender, the greatest ship in the world, yeah - no!
This is a tribute

To the greatest ship in the world, alright
It was the greatest ship in the world, alright
This is the best motherfin' ship, the greatest ship in the world, alright

And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The ship that we built on that fateful night
Didn't look anything like this ship

Because this is just a tribute
You gotta believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion

Oh, what the f
Good God, gotta love him
I'm so surprised to find you can't stop me now
The fiery ring of fire
It's motherf**ing, the greatest ship
